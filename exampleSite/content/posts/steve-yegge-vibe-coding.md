This is one of the most insightful discussions on the future of coding I've heard recently. Steve Yegge argues that we are moving away from traditional IDEs towards a "Vibe Coding" era where AI agents handle the bulk of implementation.

He critiques current tools for being "too safe" and suggests we need to embrace a more chaotic, high-level directive approach. It's not just about autocomplete; it's about architectural delegation.
